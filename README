NAME

	Convert::UUlib - Perl interface to the uulib library (as used in
        uudeview/uuenview)

PROPAGANDA

        Convert::UUlib is a versatile and powerful decoder/encoder library
        for a variety of encodings used in Usenet and Mail (uuencode,
        xxencode, b64, binhex...).

        The library contains a variety of heuristics to reliably decode
        any files found in the input files, wether part of a single
        mailfolder or spread over hundreds of files. Its two-pass
        architecture makes it possible to decode hundreds of megabytes in
        one sweep, without using much virtual memory.

        The encoding functions can create mime-compliant mails and
        attachments (but this is just a side-effect, the MIME::-hierarchy
        offers much better functionality).

        At the moment, the module documentation is 90% NON-existant,
        however, the example source (example-decoder) and the original
        uulib documentation (uulibdoc.dvi) should be useful starting
        points. The included documentation is merely an enumeration of the
        various constants and functions.

EXAMPLE DECODER

        The following example source reads all files given on the
        commandline and decodes any encoded files in them.

        use Convert::UUlib ':all';

        LoadFile($_) for @ARGV;

        for($i=0; $uu=GetFileListItem($i); $i++) {
           $uu->decode if $uu->state & FILE_OK;
        }
