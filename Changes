Revision history for Perl extension Convert::UUlib.

0.111 Fri May  4 22:29:09 CEST 2001
        - heuristic to decode microsoft-rfc822-headers (microsoft uses
          '\' as path seperator which is also the rfc822 quote character.
          of course they could have quoted it, but it's microsoft, so
          only the devil knows how they try to parse mime (they obviously
          haven't read the standard AGAIN). in case you wonder, this fixes
          the "c:my_documentssend.doc" "filename" problem.

	- fixed a bug in the file callback.

0.10  Tue May  2 03:31:09 CEST 2000
        - fixed one very longstanding bug that might have been the cause
          for the many mysterious segmentation faults. Hopefully.
        - improved documentation to the point that it slowly becomes useful
          as a (very quick) reference.

	- removed END { CleanUp } from UUlib.pm, perl is too
          buggy to rely on this in the face of popen etc..

	- function names exportable (use :all-tag).
